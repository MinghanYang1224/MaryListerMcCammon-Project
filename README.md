# The Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Project

This repository contains Julia code and data associated to my Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Project. In this project I worked on the implementation of a survival regression model based on ordinary differential equations in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). The main reference for the implemented models is:

> Christen, J. A., and Rubio, F. J. (2024+). Dynamic Survival Analysis: Modelling the Hazard Function via Ordinary Differential Equations. *Statistical Methods in Medical Research*, in press. https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802241268504

The implementation of such models required the use of ODE Solvers ([`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/)), as well as MCMC methods from [`Turing.jl`](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl).

The repository contains the following codes:

1. `rotterdam.jl`: Julia implementation of Case Study II Christen and Rubio (2024+). This example uses the [rotterdam data set](https://rdrr.io/cran/survival/man/rotterdam.html).
2. `routinesODESurv.jl` contains all the functions used in `rotterdam.jl`.
3. `Tutorials.qmd` documents some basic survival analysis overview, the hazard-response model, the Bayesian methods and MCMC, and some results summary.
4. `rotterdamFull.csv` is the data set that contains information of breast cancer patients data for analysis. See [rotterdam data set](https://rdrr.io/cran/survival/man/rotterdam.html) for more information.
5. `MLE.txt` and `logMLE.txt` are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters ($\lambda, \kappa, \alpha, \beta$) in original and logarithm scales respectively.
6. `postsamp.csv` is a file of posterior samples generated by using turing in `rotterdam.jl`.

See also [ODESurv](https://github.com/FJRubio67/ODESurv) for R and Python code.

# The Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Fellowship

This fellowship programme is a 10 week research project from 1 July 2024 to 6 September 2024, supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and by the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London and University College London. The author would like to express deep gratitude to the sponsors of this project and her supervisor Dr Javier Rubio from Department of Statistics at University College London. His guidance and assistance have made this a fruitful, inspiring, and unforgettable experience.
