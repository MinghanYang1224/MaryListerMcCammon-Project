# The Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Project

This repository contains Julia code and data associated to my Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Project. In this project I worked on the implementation of a survival regression model based on ordinary differential equations in the Julia programming language. The main reference for the implemented models is:

The repository contains the following codes:

1. `rotterdam.jl`: Julia code for ...
2. `routinesODESurv.jl` contains ...
